=== Setting the Password for the Administrative User

{product-title} uses a unique `admin` user to control all functions in the web-based user interface.
After installing the appliance, change the default password of the `admin` to restrict administrative access to the appliance's UI.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} appliances are designed for `admin` users with `root` access. Red Hat does not recommend or support {product-title_short} appliance configurations with users lacking `root` access.   

Use default credentials (Username: admin | Password: smartvm) for the initial login.

Changing the `admin` password uses the same process as changing any standard user in the appliance.

. Access the appliance through your web browser and log in. 
. Click image:config-gear.png[] (*Configuration*).
. In the accordion tree on the left, click on *Access Control*, then select the *Administrator* under the *Users* section.
  This displays the details for the `admin` user.
. On the details page, select menu:Configuration[Edit this user] from the toolbar.
. Enter a new password in the *Change Password / Confirm Password* fields.
. Click *Save* at the bottom of the page.
. Log out of the user interface.
. Test your new password by logging into the user interface. Additionally, test your new password in the appliance console.

The {product-title} appliance now has a non-default `admin` password. This restricts access to your appliance's administrative functions.
